#CubedValues#
===========

##What is this##
Test repository : used for github testing and fun

##Goal##
Find a trick (if any) to guess the cube value from an input number.

##Analysis##

###Last digit diff from previous###

Diff from previous last digit sequence : (1,7,9,7,1)

###Last digit diff from previous input+result addition###
